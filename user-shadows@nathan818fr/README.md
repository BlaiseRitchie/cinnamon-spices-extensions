## FAQ

**The shadow of some windows is not modified, what to do?**

This extension only applies to windows rendered by the cinnamon window manager (a.k.a. Muffin).
It is likely that you are dealing with [Gtk CSD windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side_decoration), whose shadow is defined by the Gtk theme you are using.
